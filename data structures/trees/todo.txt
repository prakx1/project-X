🌱 Basic Level – Must Know
These test understanding of the tree structure itself:

Inorder / Preorder / Postorder Traversal (recursive and iterative)

Level Order Traversal (BFS)

Find Height / Depth of Tree

Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced

Find the Diameter of a Binary Tree

Count the Number of Nodes / Leaves

Search a Value in Binary Search Tree (BST)

Insert/Delete in BST

Mirror a Binary Tree

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in Binary Tree

Root to node Path

🌿 Medium Level – Problem Solving
These often come up in FAANG or product-based company rounds:

Validate if a Binary Tree is a BST

Right / Left View of a Binary Tree

Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Convert Sorted Array to Balanced BST

Print All Root-to-Leaf Paths

Sum of All Nodes at a Given Level

Find Path with Given Sum

Find Distance Between Two Nodes

Boundary Traversal of Binary Tree

Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List (Leetcode #114)

🌳 Advanced Level – Optimization / Trickier Logic
These questions assess deep understanding and optimization:

Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Construct Tree from Inorder and Preorder/Postorder

Kth Smallest / Largest in BST

Vertical Order Traversal

Maximum Path Sum in Binary Tree (Leetcode #124)

Binary Tree Right Side View

Find All Nodes Distance K from a Target

Convert Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List

Trie Implementation (Prefix Tree)

Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree (if asked in CP-heavy roles)
